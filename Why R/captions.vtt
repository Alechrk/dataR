00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:07.490
So we will be using R? Why R? Basically its
because its the best statistical software

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.040
out there. It's free, it's open source, and
it's incredible powerful and easy to use.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.999
Over the past 5 to 7 years, practically all
the companies in the industry have transitioned

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:28.820
into R. And also in the academical world,
most researches are using R. Right now, its

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:36.579
very hard to find a statistics paper that
was published not using R. One of the great

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.960
things that R has is that it allows to create
new packages, so every single day a lot of

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.730
people from around the world will be uploading
new packages and new functions. So you will

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:56.059
always feel that you are using the latest
techniques and software out there. Apart from

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:03.399
this great thing (that it allows you to install
new things) R is a very powerful plotting

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:11.860
tool. It allows you to create very powerful
charts. To be honest, I think that the greatest

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.000
drawback that R has, is that it is a rather
limited tool for data processing. What happens

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.259
a lot in the industry is that you will need
to pre-process your data a lot before modelling.

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.939
So because R is not the greatest tool out
there for data processing, you will always

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.869
feel that you need to do some things in Excel
before actually modelling
